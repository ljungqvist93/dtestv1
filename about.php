            I'm Daniel - a nerdy web developer from Sweden with a huge love for writing.
        </h1>

        <p>
        	For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to make my own website, where I could write about
        	technology, and at times other stuff that just comes into my head. Why haven't it happened until
        	now, you might ask? to be honest - I got no idea. I've always just put it on hold, or worst still,
        	I've began the website, wanting a WAY to ambitious project, and ended out loosing interest
        	because things doesn't result in the way I want.
        </p>
        <p>
        	My goul with this site was extremly simple. Build something simple, easy and fast to navigate, and
        	focus wholeheartedly on creating and delivering oustanding contant, time after time.
        </p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
        	I don't have any education for what I do, and what I'm interested in. I love to create websites,
        	and I've build this site from scratch with HTML, JavaScript (jQuery), CSS and a bit of PHP. I'm first
        	and foremost a front-end developer, and I use Sublime Text 3 with a few extensions to make my
        	coding experience a bit easier.
        </p>
        <p>
        	I'm also on GitHub - here's my website's repository.
        </p>
        <p>
        	I'm do not have an education for anything I do. I've learned all stuff web development from years
        	and years of bascially trying until I succeed. 
        </p>
